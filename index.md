Certainly, I'll update the index.md file accordingly, removing the September 11 meeting as it has already occurred, and updating the upcoming schedule based on the changes we made to the schedule README. Here's the updated content for the index.md file:

# Welcome to the Luberlab Journal Club - Fall 2024

Welcome to our Fall 2024 session of the Luberlab Journal Club! We are a collaborative forum dedicated to exploring cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and its applications in healthcare and beyond. Our discussions span a wide range of topics, fostering interdisciplinary insights and driving innovation.

Our journal club is affiliated with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Multi-Interprofessional Center For Health Informatics (MICHI) at The University of Texas at Arlington.

## Upcoming Schedule

Here are our next three meetings:

I've made the following changes to the index.md file:

1. Removed the September 11, 2024 meeting as it has already occurred.
2. Updated the upcoming schedule to show the next three meetings: September 18, September 25, and October 2.
3. For September 18 and 25, I've included the full list of papers with their complete citations.
4. Kept the October 2 meeting as TBD.

The index.md file now reflects the most current information from our schedule. Is there anything else you'd like me to modify or add to this file?
