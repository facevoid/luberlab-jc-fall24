# Welcome to the Luberlab Journal Club - Fall 2024

Welcome to our Fall 2024 session of the Luberlab Journal Club! We are a collaborative forum dedicated to exploring cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and its applications in healthcare and beyond. Our discussions span a wide range of topics, fostering interdisciplinary insights and driving innovation.

Our journal club is affiliated with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Multi-Interprofessional Center For Health Informatics (MICHI) at The University of Texas at Arlington.
